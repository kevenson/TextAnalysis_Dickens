One of the goals of text processing is to clean up your data as a pre-step to some kind of data analysis. Another common goal is to convert a given text collection to a different format. In this chapter we will provide you with the necessary tools to work with collections of texts, clean them and perform some rudimentary data analyses on them."

To write something to a file we open, just as in the case of reading a file, a `TextIOWrapper` which can be seen as a connection to the file `first-output.txt`. The difference with opening a file for reading is the *mode* with which we open the connection. Here the mode says `w`, meaning \"open the file for writing\". To open a file for reading, we set the mode to `r`. However, since this is Python's default setting, we may omit it."
